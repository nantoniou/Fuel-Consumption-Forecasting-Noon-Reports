# Noon Report Data Analytics and Fuel Consumption Forecasting

This notebook offers a glimpse into the processes being conducted by data-driven shipping lines, in order to utilise the data from the noon reports (data sent by every vessel around noon, containing information revolving around weight, speed, location, and consumption).

The utilisation can be simple, like pure graph plotting. This might come after the data cleansing phase; necessary in noon reports, since they usually contain erroneous data, due to their nature of manual input.

Ultimately, the most advanced noon-report analytical applications utilise the data, in order to build statistical or machine learning models that predict fuel consumption.
